IBM Granite is a series of decoder-only AI foundation models created by IBM. It was announced on September 7, 2023 and an initial paper was published 4 days later. Initially intended for use in the IBM's cloud-based data and generative AI platform Watsonx along with other models, IBM opened the source code of some code models.[7] Granite models are trained on datasets curated from Internet, academic publishings, code datasets, legal and finance documents.

A foundation model is an AI model trained on broad data at scale such that it can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.

Granite's first foundation models were Granite.13b.instruct and Granite.13b.chat. The "13b" in their name comes from 13 billion, the amount of parameters they have as models, lesser than most of the larger models of the time. Later models vary from 3 to 34 billion parameters.

On May 6, 2024, IBM released the source code of four variations of Granite Code Models under Apache 2, an open source permissive license that allows completely free use, modification and sharing of the software, and put them on Hugging Face for public use According to IBM's own report, Granite 8b outperforms Llama 3 on several coding related tasks within similar range of parameters.

Key Features of IBM Granite include:
-Open Source: Granite models are available under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing developers to experiment with, modify, and distribute them for free.
- Versatility: The Granite family includes models for various purposes:
- Granite for Language: Accurate natural language processing in multiple languages
- Granite for Code: Trained on over 100 programming languages for enterprise-level software tasks
- Granite for Time Series: Fine-tuned for time series forecasting
- Granite for GeoSpatial: Developed with NASA for Earth observation and environmental tracking
- Performance: IBM claims that Granite models, such as Granite 8b, outperform comparable models like Llama 3 on several coding-related tasks
- Efficiency: With sizes starting from 3 billion parameters, Granite models are designed to be more efficient than larger models, potentially reducing environmental impact while maintaining performance on specialized business tasks3.
IBM Granite models are integrated into IBM's cloud-based data and generative AI platform, watsonx.ai, providing businesses with powerful tools for various AI applications in enterprise settings.
